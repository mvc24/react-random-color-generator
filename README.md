# Random Color Generator

## Description

This app lets you generate a random colour by pressing one button, showing the value of the colour in a box.

There are further options to manipulate the colour by selecting a luminosity or setting a hue, and the size of the box can be changed.

## Things to work out in the future:

- Making the font color in the box change from white to black depending on whether the generated colour is light or dark. Trying to implement this feature using the library 'color' and writing a function with a ternary operator always broke the entire app.
- Create a working reset button.
- Re-work the styling to be all in one place and not scattered over the Components.js and Index.css files.
- Style the input fields to match the rest of the design.
- Figure out why setting the hue doesn't affect the generated colour when opening it on a mobile phone.
